# Cosmic Background Music

Roughly after some 13 billion years later, some creatures appeared
on this planet and developed curiosity. They built tools and
technology, and observed the footprints of their atomic ancestors
-- some individual photons that have been redshifted for so long,
silently, waiting to be known.
